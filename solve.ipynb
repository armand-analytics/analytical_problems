    "******Analytical Exercise\n",
    " \n",
    "Banc ABC is a large US Bank that is protected by F5, Inc. They have approached F5 with a special request. They have set up special infrastructure in their environment to service financial aggregators like Mint and \n",
    "Plaid who login in to accounts on behalf of Banc ABC’s customers. Traditionally no attention has been paid to these aggregators and they have been allowed unfettered access to Banc ABC’s systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new CISO has taken the reins at Banc ABC and has requested that we look at all the aggregator transactions and provide her with a report. She is specifically concerned about the rate at which aggregators are \n",
    "logging into accounts. She is proposing limiting each aggregator to 1 login per account per 10 min interval and would like to know what impact this will have on the aggregators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Provided\n",
    "You have been provided with two CSV files for the purpose of this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tAggregator IP List.csv\n",
    "Contains a list of all the allowlisted (whitelisted) IPs that belong to known financial aggregators that are allowed by Banc ABC to access their customer’s accounts. The format of the file is\n",
    "IP: contains the IP addresses belonging to the aggregators that have been allowlisted\n",
    "Aggregator: contains the name of the aggregator that owns the respective allowlisted IP address\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tLogin Transactions.csv\n",
    "This file contains all the logins observed by F5 over a 24 hour period on Banc ABC’s special Aggregator ONLY endpoint. This endpoint was set up specifically to process transactions for the allowlisted aggregators so as not \n",
    "to interfere with regular customer traffic which uses a different endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of the file is:\n",
    "IP: This is the IP address from which the login transaction came\n",
    "LoginSuccess: This is an indicator of whether or not the login was successful i.e. had the correct accountName and password pair\n",
    "AccountName: this is the account that the transaction was trying to log into\n",
    "Timestamp: this is the epoch timestamp at which the respective login transaction was received\n",
    "-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Required\n",
    "Produce a presentation for Banc ABC’s CISO and her team covering the following questions as well as any other insights you may deem important to bring to Banc ABC’s attention.\n",
    "1.\tWhich aggregators are accessing Banc ABC’s systems?\n",
    "2.\tHow much volume are the aggregators sending?\n",
    "3.\tHow many individual user accounts are being accessed by the aggregators?\n",
    "4.\tWhat is the login success rate of these aggregators and is this in line with what would be expected in your opinion?\n",
    "5.\tWhat is the average number of transactions each aggregator sends per 10min interval?\n",
    "6.\tWhat is the maximum number of transactions each aggregator sends per 10min interval?\n",
    "7.\tWhat would be the impact of the CISO’s proposal to limit each aggregator to 1 login per account per 10 min interval?\n",
    "\n",
    "Guidance\n",
    "●\tFeel free to use any analytical tools you feel comfortable with to perform the analysis and prepare the presentation for the CISO. We recommend, but do not require, use of Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "●\tBe prepared to show your code or worksheets and to answer questions about your thought and analytical processes.\n",
    "●\tPresentation will be over Zoom to the Banc ABC CISO and will be scheduled for 1 hour, including questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have 3 days to prepare the deck and email it to the Banc ABC CISO (please email directly to the Threat Analytics & Reporting team distro: tar@f5.com)\n",
